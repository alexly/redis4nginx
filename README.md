Description.
=============

This is an Nginx module that allows you to make requests to the Redis server in a non blocking mode. 
The module supports the Redis 2.x. It can operate with the protocols of TCP / Unix Domain Sockets, also supports pipelining.

This module returns parsed response from the Redis server. It's recommended to use Redis server side scripting(LUA). 
Thus, we can obtain the desired response format on the Redis Server side.

Example:

redis.call("set", "testkey", "testvalue");

...

value= redis.call("get", â€œtestkey");

json_value = { true, { foo = "bar", val= value} }

json_text = cjson.encode(value)

return json_text;

-- Returns: '[true,{"foo":"bar", "val": "testvalue"}]'
